# MSoftware Development in Teams with Open Source Tools

In the 6th semester, I joined a class on a collaborative software development project using open-source tools. The course emphasized teamwork and covered advanced topics in software development, including:

    Centralized version control with SVN (TortoiseSVN)
    Distributed version control with Git
    Build management using Maven
    Software testing and integration testing
    Error management
    Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)

The project repository on GitHub showcases a Maven-based project, including integration tests and resident mock tests, all implemented in Java. This assignment highlighted best practices in modern software development workflows and reinforced the importance of automation and version control in team environments.
